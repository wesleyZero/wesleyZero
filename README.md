### A little about me (my origin story)
I was born at Stanford hospital and grew up in the heart of silicon valley, just a short drive from the worlds largest technology companies. Being so submersed in the world of technololgy from my earliest memories, actually made me initially want to get away from it, do and be something different. I didn't want to _be like those nerds on their computers all day?_ did I? no! no way! Like most teenagers I aspired to blaze my own path. In high school I knew that I loved chemistry, and I knew that whatever I did, I wanted to learn how to do those cool multi-step organic synthesis problems. It looked so cool, and it was! However, researching what the life of most people with B.S. degrees in chemistry were like, it seemed that you needed to get a PhD to do the really cool stuff. At 17, I wasn't prepared to dedicate myself to that much schooling. (Quite ironic looking back on it). Unfortunately, I didn't have any relationship to my parents and grew up with _many_ hardships. I wanted to do something safer, but aligned with my passions. It seemed that chemical engineering was the right path for me. It involved chemistry, and it made enough money that I could be independent. No one in my family had ever graduated from college before, so I had no idea what to expect. **So at 17, I decided that I was going to go to college to become a chemical engineer.** At the time, all I had taken was AP chemistry and pre-calculus. 

I started in community college, in Santa Cruz California. I worked part time as a tutor and excelled at my studies because I was so passionate at what I did. I loved how difficult chemical engineering was, and I wanted to be the best at it! In high school, I had many hardships and consequently didn't have any good grades. So in college, I became obsessed with good grades to prove my abilities. I spent a total of 5 years in community college building myself up from nearly nothing. I studied calculus, linear algebra, differential equations. Organic chemsitry, materials science. I took a circuit analysis class and learned a bit about how the EE's think.
