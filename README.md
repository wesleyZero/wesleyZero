### A little about me (my origin story)
I was born at Stanford hospital and grew up in the heart of silicon valley, just a short drive from the worlds largest technology companies. Being so submersed in the world of technololgy from my earliest memories, actually made me initially want to get away from it, do and be something different. I didn't want to _be like those nerds on their computers all day?_ did I? no! no way! Like most teenagers I aspired to blaze my own path. In high school I knew that I loved chemistry, and I knew that whatever I did, I wanted to learn how to do those cool multi-step organic synthesis problems. It looked so cool, and it was! However, researching what the life of most people with B.S. degrees in chemistry were like, it seemed that you needed to get a PhD to do the really cool stuff. At 17, I wasn't prepared to dedicate myself to that much schooling. (Quite ironic looking back on it). Unfortunately, I didn't have any relationship to my parents and grew up with _many_ hardships. I wanted to do something safer, but aligned with my passions. It seemed that chemical engineering was the right path for me. It involved chemistry, and it made enough money that I could be independent. No one in my family had ever graduated from college before, so I had no idea what to expect. **So at 17, I decided that I was going to go to college to become a chemical engineer.** At the time, all I had taken was AP chemistry and pre-calculus. 

I started in community college, in Santa Cruz California. I worked part time as a tutor and excelled at my studies because I was so passionate at what I did. I loved how difficult chemical engineering was, and I wanted to be the best at it! In high school, I had many hardships and consequently didn't have any good grades. So in college, I became obsessed with good grades to prove my abilities. I spent a total of 5 years in community college building myself up from nearly nothing. I studied calculus, linear algebra, differential equations. Organic chemsitry, materials science, physics. I took a circuit analysis class and learned a bit about how the EE's think. **In my last year, I took C++ and loved it, and I mean _really loved it_.** I loved it so much that even after 4 years of doing all of the chemical engineering pre-requisites I thought about shifting gears to becoming a computer science student, but I didn't think that it made much sense to change my entire life plan because I spent a few weeks enjoying my C++ class. My college transfer admissions applicaion was due in just a few weeks and even more importantly... I was homeless... I didn't see how I could spend another year in community college in such a difficult situation. Out of fear, I wanted to do the safer thing, and continue with chemical engineering. Going to university seemed like my life raft to a sinking ship (my life and financial situation). I needed to get out this situation. After all, I was tired from sacrificing so much of myself for school. I had a 3.96 GPA in my transfer application and didn't want to risk messing it up, because trying to excel in school while homeless and in such a difficult situation, a challenge that I wouldn't wish others to ever know. I was not in a situation finacially or even psychologically to want to take on more risk. 

So... I filled out my application, and applied. A few months later I got into every top public chemical engineering program in California (woo!). The top two choices were UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley. Santa Barbara has classes half the size of Berkeley and it seemed that you had much more personal interaction with your professors (which was true). For chemical engineering, it seemed to be the more competitive option. It was also in a spectactular location. Most importantly, it had guaranteed housing for transfer studnets... as someone that was homeless and looking for stability, that was something that I couldn't turn down. I read a few horror stories of people transferring to Berkeley and not being able to find housing in the super expensive bay area market. Looking into all these details, it seemed that Santa Barbara was the better option and I decided to go there. 

After transferring to UC Santa Barbara, I got submersed in the world of chemical engineering for the first time. Chemical engineering is very 'niche', it was the smallest engineering major by class size at the school and I never had much exposure to what the field was like before I got there. Especially being the first in my family to go to college, I just had no idea what I signed up for. Literally and figuratively speaking. Unfortunately, I discovered that I really didn't like chemical engineering much at all... I loved math, physics, chemistry, and all of the pre-requisites but chemical engineering really was uniquely it's own thing and I wasn't a fan of it. After just two weeks I knew that this just wasn't for me and after finishing my last final of the quarter I went straight to the computer science office to see if I could switch majors. To my great dissapoinment, this was not an option... despite excelling at so many different subjects, and getting into the most competitive public program in California for my major. I wasn't allowed to switch my major?? What the heck? I was allowed to switch out of engineeing, to any other major I wanted. But nothing within the college of engineering... 

With little passion for chemical engineering, I dragged my feet and persevered. In my second quarter, life wanted to throw another traumatic event my way after overcoming homelessness. My sister became schitzophrenic and had completetly lost her mind. That was the closest family member I had, and I had no connection with my parents at all and my sister was the only family member I grew up with that I had any connection with. This was a huge blow to me on a personal level.
